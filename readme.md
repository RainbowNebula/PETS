# Periodically Exchange Teacher-Student for Source-Free Object Detection
- üîîThis is the re-implementation code for the paper "Periodically Exchange Teacher-Student for Source-Free Object Detection", ICCV 2023.
- Sometimes, it's also feasible to apply exchange strategies within a single teacher-student framework to alleviate instability issues.

# üõ†Ô∏èSetup
## Runtime

The main python libraries we use:
- Python 3.8
- torch 1.8.1
- [detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2)

## Datasets
For convenience, the data annotation files have been uniformly processed into JSON files following COCO format. By the way, we have also processed the Clipart1K and Watercolor used in other methods. The source images of the dataset requires an additional download. The dataset configurations can be changed in PETS/ubteacher/data/datasets/builtin.py.

## Source Weights

The C2F and C2B tasks share source weights in the method.

# üé¢Run
For example, to run the experiment, just enter the following cmd on root directory:
```shell
python train_net --config configs/UDA/C2F.yaml
```
